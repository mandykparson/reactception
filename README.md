## General Info

This app has two parts to it: The side that the user sees and the side that actually makes it all work. I was a bit of mind warp to do this project as it involved me having to make it while I was making it. The right side of the screen shows what the code ultimately does while the left side of the screen explains all the steps it took to get there. I chose to do all of the coding using functional components in React. 

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* React
* CSS

## Features

You can access the db.json at any time by clicking on the left side of screen labeled "access db.json". Clicking on the main button changes the code that you see to reflect the step you clicked on. For example: clicking "import state" will reveal the code that now includes an imported state. 

## Status

There are sill a few bugs to work through on this project. Ultimately I wanted the screen to reflect the code that was shown on the left but that proved to be ... very difficult. I want to continue to make the screen appear to be more interactive than it is currently. 

## Inspiration

The movie Inception and wanting to see how React all connected when I was first learning it were my main sources of inspiration. A "component within a component" just lent itself too nicely to the movie and I had to play it all out just to see if I could. I had to re-watch the movie to get all the references that were made in this website but the user shouldn't need to know the movie to understand the underlying principles of this website!
